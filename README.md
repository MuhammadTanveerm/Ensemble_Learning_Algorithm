             Ensemble learning is a significant concept in machine learning where multiple models are used together to improve prediction accuracy. The basic idea behind ensemble learning is that combining the outputs of several models may yield better results than relying on a single model. This approach is especially useful when working with complex problems where individual models might not perform as well.⁣⁣

 𝟏. 𝐁𝐚𝐠𝐠𝐢𝐧𝐠⁣⁣
•	Bagging, or Bootstrap Aggregating, involves training multiple models in parallel using different subsets of the data. The final prediction is made by combining the results from all models.⁣⁣
⁣⁣
•	𝐏𝐚𝐫𝐚𝐥𝐥𝐞𝐥 𝐌𝐨𝐝𝐞𝐥𝐬: Models are trained independently and simultaneously.⁣⁣
•	𝐕𝐚𝐫𝐢𝐚𝐧𝐜𝐞 𝐑𝐞𝐝𝐮𝐜𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧: Bagging helps in reducing variance by averaging multiple predictions, which makes it less sensitive to data fluctuations.⁣⁣
•	𝐂𝐨𝐦𝐦𝐨𝐧 𝐄𝐱𝐚𝐦𝐩𝐥𝐞: Random Forest is a classic example of a bagging model. It combines multiple decision trees for classification or regression tasks.⁣⁣
•	𝐀𝐩𝐩𝐥𝐢𝐜𝐚𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧: Bagging is particularly useful when you need to reduce the variance in the predictions, making it ideal for high-variance models such as decision trees.⁣⁣
𝟐. 𝐁𝐨𝐨𝐬𝐭𝐢𝐧𝐠⁣⁣
•	 Boosting is an ensemble technique where models are trained sequentially. Each new model focuses on the errors made by previous models, improving upon them.⁣⁣
⁣⁣
•	𝐒𝐞𝐪𝐮𝐞𝐧𝐭𝐢𝐚𝐥 𝐌𝐨𝐝𝐞𝐥𝐬: The models are trained one after the other, with each new model correcting the mistakes of the previous ones.⁣⁣
•	𝐁𝐢𝐚𝐬 𝐑𝐞𝐝𝐮𝐜𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧: Boosting is primarily used to reduce bias by giving more weight to incorrectly classified data points.⁣⁣
•	𝐂𝐨𝐦𝐦𝐨𝐧 𝐄𝐱𝐚𝐦𝐩𝐥𝐞: AdaBoost (Adaptive Boosting) is a popular boosting algorithm that adjusts the weights of incorrect predictions.⁣⁣
•	𝐀𝐩𝐩𝐥𝐢𝐜𝐚𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧: Boosting is best suited for improving the performance of weak learners by combining them into a stronger, more accurate model.⁣⁣
𝟑. 𝐒𝐭𝐚𝐜𝐤𝐢𝐧𝐠⁣⁣
•	 Stacking involves training multiple models and combining their outputs to create a new dataset, which is then used by another model to make predictions.⁣⁣
⁣⁣
•	𝐌𝐨𝐝𝐞𝐥 𝐂𝐨𝐦𝐛𝐢𝐧𝐚𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧: The outputs from several base models are used to form a new dataset, and another model is trained on this dataset to make the final prediction.⁣⁣
•	𝐈𝐦𝐩𝐫𝐨𝐯𝐞𝐝 𝐏𝐞𝐫𝐟𝐨𝐫𝐦𝐚𝐧𝐜𝐞: By combining the outputs from different models, stacking often results in improved accuracy and robustness.⁣⁣
•	𝐂𝐨𝐦𝐦𝐨𝐧 𝐄𝐱𝐚𝐦𝐩𝐥𝐞: A stacking model may combine outputs from decision trees, support vector machines (SVM), and logistic regression, with a final estimator like Logistic Regression or Random Forest to make the final prediction.⁣⁣
•	𝐀𝐩𝐩𝐥𝐢𝐜𝐚𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧: Stacking is used when you want to combine the strengths of different models and improve prediction accuracy.⁣⁣
